Shutdown is an application for 16/32 bit machines that shuts the pc off. It needs to be an APM compatible machine, however most x86s should be able to handle this executable.

This application can be compiled using either Magic Assembler (if you are signed up on the casmOS site and have access to fileshare) or NASM for everybody else. You may choose between whichever one you like to compile with, just change %XNASM% in build.bat to %MASM% to compile with the alternate compiler.
