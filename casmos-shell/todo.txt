casmOS needs alot more than just freecom and kernel. Some applications that should be looked further into adding is the following:

- casmOS Official Splash
- FORMAT.COM (THE NAME IS LITERALLY WHAT IT DOES)
- FDISK.EXE (FIXED DISK PARTITION EDITOR)
- MOUSE.EXE (mouse driver for casmOS)
- MINI.CAB contents (will make casmOS less open source but that is the only place where this will not be open source anyway so...)
- CALCULATOR.EXE (shell/wm)
- WPSFCASMOS (based on IBM Workplace Shell For Windows)
- WINBAR (alternate wm for casmOS in case of WPSFCASMOS failure in compilation)
- CALMIRA II (another wm for casmOS to look just like Win95)
